summary: Transpiling PureScript to Nix
tags: haskell, nixos, purescript

------------------------------------------------------

My friend [Jonas Carpay](https://jonascarpay.com/)
([@jonascarpay](https://github.com/jonascarpay)) and I recently released
[PureNix](https://github.com/purenix-org/purenix).  PureNix is a Nix backend for
[PureScript](https://www.purescript.org/).  PureNix allows you to write
PureScript code and transpile it to Nix code.  This can be helpful when trying
to write large or tricky code in Nix.

This blog post series is all about PureNix.  It explains how to get started with
PureNix, why we wrote PureNix, when you might want to use PureNix, and more.
If you just want to play around with PureNix, all you need is the first post.


1.  [Getting Started with PureNix](./2021-12-27-getting-started-with-purenix)

    This post gives a high-level overview of PureNix, and explains how to setup
    an environment for playing around with it.

2.  Why PureNix? (coming soon)

    This post explains why we decided to write PureNix.

3.  Under the Hood of PureNix (coming soon)

    This post explains how PureNix works internally.  It talks about what goes
    in to writing a new PureScript backend.

4.  PureNix vs. Nix (coming soon)

    This post talks about when you should choose PureNix over writing in raw
    Nix.

5.  PureNix vs. Nickel (coming soon)

    This post compares PureNix to Nickel.

6.  PureNix Project Ideas (coming soon)

    This post is a list of ideas for projects that would be neat to write
    in PureNix.  Some project ideas are just jokes.

7.  Contributing to the PureNix and the Ecosystem (coming soon)

    This post lists different parts of the PureNix ecosystem we'd love to get
    help with.  There are tons of things that we'd like to improve.

8.  `cabal2nixWithoutIFD` (coming soon)

    This is an overview of the
    [`cabal2nixWithoutIFD`](https://github.com/cdepillabout/cabal2nixWithoutIFD)
    project.  This is a proof-of-concept implementation of
    [`callCabal2nix`](https://bytes.zone/posts/callcabal2nix/) written using
    PureNix.

9.  Efficient `unfoldr` Implementation in Nix with `builtins.genericClosure` (coming soon)
