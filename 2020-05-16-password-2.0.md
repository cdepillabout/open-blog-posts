------------------------------------------------------

I recently helped with the release of the
[password-2.0](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-2.0.1.1) library.

This 2.0 release corresponds to a big rewrite of the `password` library,
spearheaded entirely by [Felix Paulusma](https://github.com/Vlix).

The biggest improvement in 2.0 is the addition of a few new options for hashing
algorithms, including
[Argon2](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-2.0.1.1/docs/Data-Password-Argon2.html),
[Bcrypt](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-2.0.1.1/docs/Data-Password-Bcrypt.html),
and
[PBKDF2](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-2.0.1.1/docs/Data-Password-PBKDF2.html).

## What is the `password` library?

The [`password`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-2.0.1.1) library
was originally intended to be used by people implementing username/password
authentication in web applications, but it is now easily usable by anyone
dealing with passwords and password hashing in any type of application.

There are four main advantages of using `password`:

-   Cannonical
    [`Password`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-2.0.1.1/docs/Data-Password.html#t:PasswordHash)
    and
    [`PasswordHash`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-2.0.1.1/docs/Data-Password.html#t:PasswordHash)
    types that can be shared throughout your code. These are meant to be simple
    types with reasonable typeclass instances.  You should be able to take
    `password` as a dependency and rely on these types from other libraries.

-   Easy-to-use functions for hashing a `Password`, and checking a
    `PasswordHash` against a `Password`.

-   An optional
    [password-instances](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-instances-2.0.0.1)
    package that provides additional typeclass instances for `Password` and
    `PasswordHash`, like
    [`FromJSON`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-instances-2.0.0.1/docs/Data-Password-Instances.html#v:-36-fFromJSONPassword)
    (from [aeson](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson)),
    [FromHttpApiData](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-instances-2.0.0.1/docs/Data-Password-Instances.html#v:-36-fFromHttpApiDataPassword)
    (from [http-api-data](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/http-api-data)),
    and
    [PersistField](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-instances-2.0.0.1/docs/Data-Password-Instances.html#v:-36-fFromHttpApiDataPassword)
    (from [persistent](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/persistent)).  These
    instances are frequently used when doing actual web development.

-   Great documentation.  Anything that is confusing in the Haddocks is
    considered a "high-priority" bug.

## What was changed in `password-2.0`?


## Future Work

-   security audit
-   splitting off the Data.Password module into a separate package called `password-types`.
-   adding more password hashing algorithms
-   splitting the `password-instances` package into separate packages like `password-instances-aeson`.
-   adding more helpful `password-instances` instances.
