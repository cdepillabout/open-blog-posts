*This post is the third post in a [series about PureNix](./2022-01-03-purenix).
The previous post is about
[who would find PureNix easy to use](./2022-01-05-who-would-like-purenix).*

[PureNix]() started out half as a joke.  This post explains why we started
working on PureNix, and how it moved from a joke to something we are excited
about.

## The Idea

I was a mentor for [Summer of Nix 2021](https://summer.nixos.org/).  One of the
nice things about Summer of Nix is that the organizers arranged for various
people in the Nix community to give presentations about Nix-related topics.
One of the presentations was from [@adisbladis](https://github.com/adisbladis)
about [poetry2nix](https://github.com/nix-community/poetry2nix).

`poetry2nix` is a Nix library for building Python packages that use
[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to build.

## Conclusion

*This post is the second post in a
[series about PureNix](./2022-01-03-purenix).  The previous post is about
[getting started with PureNix](./2022-01-04-getting-started-with-purenix).
The next post is about
[why we started writing PureNix](./2022-01-10-why-purenix).*

## Using PureNix Professionally

If your company is considering PureNix in order to tame a complicated Nix
codebase, [Jonas](https://jonascarpay.com/) and I currently have time available
for consulting or freelance.  Feel free to [get in touch](/about).  We are also
available for any other Nix/Haskell/PureScript-related work.
