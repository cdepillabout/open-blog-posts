My friend [Jonas Carpay](https://jonascarpay.com/)
([@jonascarpay](https://github.com/jonascarpay)) and I recently released
[PureNix](https://github.com/purenix-org/purenix).  PureNix is a Nix backend for
[PureScript](https://www.purescript.org/).  PureNix allows you to write
PureScript code and transpile it to Nix code.  This can be helpful when trying
to write large or tricky code in Nix.

This blog post series is all about PureNix.  It explains how to get started with
PureNix, why we wrote PureNix, when you might want to use PureNix, and more.
If you just want to play around with PureNix, all you need is the first post.
