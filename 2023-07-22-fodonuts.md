Nix provides two main types of derivations:

1. normal derivations
2. fixed-output derivations (FODs)

The big difference is that fixed-output derivations allow you to access the
internet from within the Nix build sandbox.  However, they require you to give the
hash of the derivation output in advance.

Aside from some [exotic use-cases](https://github.com/cdepillabout/evil-nix),
fixed-output derivations are generally used to download files from the
internet.  Here's an example of a fixed-output derivation you may be familiar
with:

```nix
fetchurl {
  url = "http://www.example.org/hello-1.0.tar.gz";
  sha256 = "0v6r3wwnsk5pdjr188nip3pjgn1jrn5pc5ajpcfy6had6b3v4dwm";
}
```

This derivation will download the tarball
`http://www.example.org/hello-1.0.tar.gz`.  Note that this tarball has to have
the sha256 hash `0v6r3wwnsk5pdjr188nip3pjgn1jrn5pc5ajpcfy6had6b3v4dwm`, or the
derivation will fail at build-time.

Aside from downloading files from the internet, there is one other good use of
fixed-output derivations: running a test (or a whole test-suite) that needs
access to the internet.  In this article I'll refer to these types of
derivations as _fixed-output derivations for operating network-utilizing tests_
(**FODONUTs**[^1]).

Here's an example of a FODONUT: imagine you're writing a derivation to build
`curl`.  After building `curl`, you naturally want to test that `curl` works
correctly. The obvious way to do this is to try to download a file from the
internet using `curl`.  However, in a normal derivation, you can't access the
internet.  One way to work around this is to create a separate fixed-output
derivation, and run the `curl` tests in that[^2].  If `curl` hasn't been built
correctly, and it can't download files from the internet correctly,
you can fail the Nix build.

If you're familiar with Nix, you'll immediately see two big problems here:

1.  FODs require the derivation output to be hashed.  But in this example, what
    should we output?  And what will its hash be?
2.  Normally, FODs don't get rebuilt unless the output of their hash changes.

This article discusses the solutions to these problems.

## A Review of Fixed-Output Derivations

First, let's have a short refresher on fixed-output derivations (FODs).

As stated above, FODs have two main differences to normal derivations:

1.  You're allowed to access the internet.
2.  You have to provide the hash of the file output from the derivation.

Let's take a look at an example of a trivial FOD:

```nix
{ stdenv }:

stdenv.mkDerivation {
  name = "fod-example-simple";

  # This is the sha256 hash for the string "hello world", which is output upon
  # this derivation building.
  outputHash = "sha256-qUiQTy8PR5uPgZdpSzAYSw0u0cHNKh7A+4XSmaGSpEc=";
  outputHashMode = "flat";
  outputHashAlgo = "sha256";

  buildCommand = ''
    echo 'hello world' > $out
  '';
}
```

The only thing this derivation does is output the string `"hello world"`.  We
can try building this from the
[example-fodonuts](https://github.com/cdepillabout/example-fodonuts) repo:

```console
$ nix build .#fod-example-simple
$ cat ./result
hello world
```

The main thing to notice here is that we must specify the hash of the the
output string `"hello world"`.  If you try building this by specifying an
incorrect hash, the build will fail.

Here's what the same derivation would look like with an incorrect hash:

```nix
{ stdenv }:

stdenv.mkDerivation {
  name = "fod-example-simple";

  # This is the sha256 hash for the string "hello world", which is output upon
  # this derivation building.
  outputHash = "sha256-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=";
  outputHashMode = "flat";
  outputHashAlgo = "sha256";

  buildCommand = ''
    echo 'hello world' > $out
  '';
}
```

Here's the error you get when you try to build:


```console
$ nix build .#fod-example-simple
error: hash mismatch in fixed-output derivation '/nix/store/wadb5ayi877q4jzqi8abk4jiiycgdhws-fod-example-simple.drv':
         specified: sha256-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=
            got:    sha256-qUiQTy8PR5uPgZdpSzAYSw0u0cHNKh7A+4XSmaGSpEc=
```

Let's take a look at a more substantial fixed-output derivation.  This uses
`curl` to download a tarball from the internet:

```
{ cacert, curl, lib, stdenv }:

stdenv.mkDerivation {

  name = "fod-example";

  # This is the sha256 hash for the string "success", which is output upon this
  # test succeeding.
  outputHash = "sha256-7k4HUasQi22k9HxS2hh9UXfcNx8PUSp8quxUNOcRwJE=";
  outputHashMode = "flat";
  outputHashAlgo = "sha256";

  nativeBuildInputs = [ curl ];

  # Needed for people using Nix behind a proxy.
  impureEnvVars = lib.fetchers.proxyImpureEnvVars;

  buildCommand = ''
    curl=(
      curl --location --max-redirs 20 --retry 3 --disable-epsv
      --cookie-jar cookies --user-agent "curl " --insecure
    )

    # Make sure curl can access HTTPS sites, like GitHub.
    export SSL_CERT_FILE="${cacert}/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt"

    "''${curl[@]}" \
      "https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases/download/13.0.0/ripgrep-13.0.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz" \
      > $out
  '';
}
```

Here's how to build it:

```console
$ nix build .#fod-example
$ file -L ./result
./result: gzip compressed data, last modified: Sat Jun 12 12:32:02 2021, from Unix, original size modulo 2^32 5601280
```

You can see that the output file is actually a gzip, as expected.

There are a couple interesting things to see notice here:

1.  If you re-run the `nix build` command, nothing happens.  The file doesn't
    get re-downloaded.

    This is because Nix knows that it doesn't need to rebuild FODs if they have
    been already built once.  How does Nix know if it has already built a FOD?
    It looks at a combination of the derivation `name` and `hash` values.  In
    this case, the `name` is `fod-example`, and the `hash` is
    `sha256-7k4HUasQi22k9HxS2hh9UXfcNx8PUSp8quxUNOcRwJE=`.

    If you change either one of these values, the derivation will be rebuilt.
    For instance, try changing the name to `foo-example-2`, and re-running `nix
    build`.  The file should be downloaded again, and a new output is created
    in the Nix store.

    If you change the `hash` value, the derivation will also be rebuilt.
    Although, like we saw above, if the hash is incorrect the build will fail.

2.  A consequence of the previous point is that if you keep the `name` and
    `hash` values the same, but change anything else in the derivation, it
    will **not** be rebuilt.  For instance, try changing the URL in the
    `buildCommand` to
    `https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases/download/12.0.0/ripgrep-12.0.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`,
    keep the `name` and `hash` values the same, and re-run `nix build`.

    You will see that `nix build` finishes cleanly, without rebuilding the
    derivation.  Nix realizes it has already built a derivation with the
    same `name` and `hash`, and just returns that output[^3].

3.  There are a couple tricky things in this derivation, like setting
    `impureEnvVars`, `SSL_CERT_FILE`, and various `curl` options.  These are
    all necessary for robustly using `curl` from within the Nix sandbox,
    but they are not particuarly interesting.  This article won't go into
    detail about them.

Now that you have an understanding of FODs, let's see how we can use them to
run tests that connect to the internet.

## FODONUTs: Fixed-Output Derivations for Operating Network-Utilizing Tests

## Conclusion

## Footnotes

[^1]: I read this as "faux donuts".

[^2]: Another common solution is to standup a webserver like Nginx on localhost
    within a normal Nix derivation, and make requests to it with `curl`.  The
    advantage here is that everything happens within a normal Nix derivation,
    and in theory it is more reproducible than accessing something out on the
    internet.  The disadvantage is that you must download all resources required
    for the tests with FODs.  While this is possible for some types of tests,
    for others it is quite the limitation.

[^3]: This is likely just an optimization.  In theory, if you've already output
    one thing with a given name/hash, it doesn't matter if you change the build
    steps, you'll still get the same value if you rebuild it.

    In practice, I'm not sure how good of a decision this is, but it is nice
    in some ways.

    Also, in this situation, if you do a garbage collection of your Nix store,
    make sure this output has been deleted, and then re-run `nix build`, it will
    of course build with the modified `buildCommand` value.
