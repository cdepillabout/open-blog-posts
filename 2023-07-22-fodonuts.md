tags: nixos
draft: false
------------------------------------------------------

Nix provides two main types of derivations:

1. normal derivations
2. fixed-output derivations (FODs)

The big difference is that fixed-output derivations allow you to access the
internet from within the Nix build sandbox.  However, they require you to give the
hash of the derivation output in advance.

Aside from some [exotic use-cases](https://github.com/cdepillabout/evil-nix),
fixed-output derivations are generally used to download tarballs and other
files from the internet.  Here's an example of a fixed-output derivation you
may be familiar with:

```nix
fetchurl {
  url = "http://www.example.org/hello-1.0.tar.gz";
  sha256 = "0v6r3wwnsk5pdjr188nip3pjgn1jrn5pc5ajpcfy6had6b3v4dwm";
}
```

This derivation will download the tarball
`http://www.example.org/hello-1.0.tar.gz`.  Note that this tarball has to have
the sha256 hash `0v6r3wwnsk5pdjr188nip3pjgn1jrn5pc5ajpcfy6had6b3v4dwm`, or the
derivation will fail after building.

Aside from downloading files from the internet, there is one other good use of
fixed-output derivations: running a test (or a whole test-suite) that needs
access to the internet.  In this article I'll refer to these types of
derivations as _fixed-output derivations for operating network-utilizing tests_
(**FODONUTs**[^1]).

Here's an example of a FODONUT. Imagine you're writing a derivation to build
`wget`.  After building `wget`, you naturally want to test that `wget` works
correctly. The obvious way to do this is use `wget` to try to download a file
from the internet.  However, in a normal derivation, you can't access the
internet.  One way to work around this is to create a separate fixed-output
derivation to run the `wget` tests[^2].  If `wget` hasn't been built
correctly, and it can't download files from the internet correctly, you can
fail the Nix build.

If you're familiar with Nix, you'll immediately see two big problems here:

1.  FODs require the derivation output to be hashed.  But in this example, what
    should we output?  And what will its hash be?
2.  Normally, FODs don't get rebuilt unless their output hash changes.

This article discusses the solutions to these problems.

## Nix Code in this Article

You can find all the Nix code for this article on GitHub.  If you want to
follow along, I recommend cloning this repo:

<https://github.com/cdepillabout/example-fodonuts>

This article has been written against `nixpkgs-unstable` from 2023-07-19, commit
[57695599bdc4f7](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/commit/57695599bdc4f7bfe5d28cfa23f14b3d8bdf8a5f).  But the Nix code here is relatively simple, and will likely work
against any recent version of Nixpkgs.

## A Review of Fixed-Output Derivations

First, let's have a short refresher on fixed-output derivations (FODs).

As stated above, FODs have two main differences to normal derivations:

1.  You're allowed to access the internet.
2.  You have to provide the hash of the file output from the derivation.

Let's take a look at an example of a trivial FOD:

[`fod-example-simple/default.nix`](https://github.com/cdepillabout/example-fodonuts/blob/main/nix/fod-example-simple/default.nix):

```nix
{ stdenv }:

stdenv.mkDerivation {
  name = "fod-example-simple";

  # This is the sha256 hash for the string "hello world", which is output upon
  # this derivation building.
  outputHash = "sha256-qUiQTy8PR5uPgZdpSzAYSw0u0cHNKh7A+4XSmaGSpEc=";
  outputHashMode = "flat";
  outputHashAlgo = "sha256";

  buildCommand = ''
    echo 'hello world' > $out
  '';
}
```

The only thing this derivation does is output the string `"hello world"`.  We
can try building this from the
[example-fodonuts](https://github.com/cdepillabout/example-fodonuts) repo:

```console
$ nix build -L .#fod-example-simple
$ cat ./result
hello world
```

The main thing to notice here is that we must specify the hash of the the
output string `"hello world"`.  If you try building this by specifying an
incorrect hash, the build will fail.

Here's what the same derivation would look like with an incorrect hash:

```nix
{ stdenv }:

stdenv.mkDerivation {
  name = "fod-example-simple";

  # This is an _incorrect_ sha256 hash for the string "hello world".
  outputHash = "sha256-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=";
  outputHashMode = "flat";
  outputHashAlgo = "sha256";

  buildCommand = ''
    echo 'hello world' > $out
  '';
}
```

Here's the error you get when you try to build:


```console
$ nix build -L .#fod-example-simple
error: hash mismatch in fixed-output derivation '/nix/store/wadb5ayi877q4jzqi8abk4jiiycgdhws-fod-example-simple.drv':
         specified: sha256-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=
            got:    sha256-qUiQTy8PR5uPgZdpSzAYSw0u0cHNKh7A+4XSmaGSpEc=
```

Let's take a look at a more substantial fixed-output derivation.  This uses
`curl` to download a tarball from the internet:

[`fod-example/default.nix`](https://github.com/cdepillabout/example-fodonuts/blob/main/nix/fod-example/default.nix):

```nix
{ cacert, curl, lib, stdenv }:

stdenv.mkDerivation {

  name = "fod-example";

  # This is the sha256 hash for the string "success", which is output upon this
  # test succeeding.
  outputHash = "sha256-7k4HUasQi22k9HxS2hh9UXfcNx8PUSp8quxUNOcRwJE=";
  outputHashMode = "flat";
  outputHashAlgo = "sha256";

  nativeBuildInputs = [ curl ];

  # Needed for people using Nix behind a proxy.
  impureEnvVars = lib.fetchers.proxyImpureEnvVars;

  buildCommand = ''
    curl=(
      curl --location --max-redirs 20 --retry 3 --disable-epsv
      --cookie-jar cookies --user-agent "curl " --insecure
    )

    # Make sure curl can access HTTPS sites, like GitHub.
    export SSL_CERT_FILE="${cacert}/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt"

    "''${curl[@]}" \
      "https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases/download/13.0.0/ripgrep-13.0.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz" \
      > $out
  '';
}
```

Here's how to build it:

```console
$ nix build -L .#fod-example
$ file -L ./result
./result: gzip compressed data, last modified: Sat Jun 12 12:32:02 2021, from Unix, original size modulo 2^32 5601280
```

You can see that the output file is actually a gzip, as expected.

There are a couple interesting things to notice here:

1.  If you re-run the `nix build` command, nothing happens.  The file doesn't
    get re-downloaded. This is because Nix knows that it doesn't need to
    rebuild FODs if they have been already built once.

    How does Nix know if it has already built an FOD? It looks at a combination
    of the derivation `name` and `hash` values.  In this case, the `name` is
    `fod-example`, and the `hash` is
    `sha256-7k4HUasQi22k9HxS2hh9UXfcNx8PUSp8quxUNOcRwJE=`.

    If you change either one of these values, the derivation will be rebuilt.
    For instance, try changing the name to `foo-example-2`, and re-running
    `nix build -L`.  The file should be downloaded again, and a new output is
    created in the Nix store.

    If you change the `hash` value, the derivation will also be rebuilt.
    Although, like we saw above, if the hash is incorrect the build will fail.

2.  A consequence of the previous point is that if you keep the `name` and
    `hash` values the same, but change anything else in the derivation, it
    will **not** be rebuilt.  For instance, try changing the URL in the
    `buildCommand` to
    `https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases/download/12.0.0/ripgrep-12.0.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`,
    keep the `name` and `hash` values the same, and re-run `nix build`.

    You will see that `nix build` finishes cleanly, _without_ rebuilding the
    derivation, or downloading the new version 12.0.0 tarball.  Nix realizes it
    has already built a derivation with the same `name` and `hash`, and just
    returns that output.  Most people new to Nix are surprised by this
    behavior![^3]

3.  There are a couple tricky things in this derivation, like setting
    `impureEnvVars`, `SSL_CERT_FILE`, and various `curl` options.  These are
    all necessary for robustly using `curl` from within the Nix sandbox,
    but they are not particuarly interesting.  This article won't go into
    detail about why they are needed.

Now that you have an understanding of FODs, let's see how we can use them to
run tests that connect to the internet.

## FODONUTs: Fixed-Output Derivations for Operating Network-Utilizing Tests

Imagine we have a program we're building with Nix.  Let's use `wget` as a
running example.  After building `wget`, we want to test that `wget` can correctly
download files from the internet. This section explains how we can leverage
_fixed-output derivations for operating network-utilizing tests_
(**FODONUTs**).

We'll work through a couple different variations on this theme, and work
towards writing a an example FODONUT that is widely useful.

### My `wget`

This section will use `wget` as an example.

Let's create a separate `wget` derivation with a custom name.  This is a
Nixpkgs overlay:

[`overlay.nix`](https://github.com/cdepillabout/example-fodonuts/blob/main/nix/overlay.nix):

```nix
final: prev: {
  my-wget = final.wget.overrideAttrs { pname = "my-wget"; };
}
```

You can try building and using this from the example-fodonuts repo:

```console
$ nix build -L .#my-wget
$ ./result/bin/wget http://google.com/ -O index.html
$ head index.html
<!doctype html><html itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/WebPage" lang="en"><head>
...
```

You can see that this `my-wget` derivation is able to be built correctly. By
running it on the command line, we can see that it appears to be working
correctly.

However, we'd still like to be able to run tests for it in a Nix derivation.

### Attempt 1: a Normal Derivation

As a first attempt at writing a derivation for running tests for `wget`, lets
see what happens if we just use a normal derivation (non-FOD):

[`my-wget-tests-attempt-1-normal-derivation/default.nix`](https://github.com/cdepillabout/example-fodonuts/blob/main/nix/my-wget-tests-attempt-1-normal-derivation/default.nix):

```nix
{ my-wget, lib, stdenv }:

stdenv.mkDerivation {

  name = "my-wget-tests-attempt-1-normal-derivation";

  nativeBuildInputs = [ my-wget ];

  # Needed for people using Nix behind a proxy.
  impureEnvVars = lib.fetchers.proxyImpureEnvVars;

  buildCommand = ''
    wget http://www.google.com -O index.html

    echo success > "$out"
  '';
}
```

This test just uses `wget` to download the homepage of <http://www.google.com>.

You can try building this derivation from the `example-fodonuts` repo:

```console
$ nix build -L .#my-wget-tests-attempt-1-normal-derivation
my-wget-tests-attempt> --2023-07-20 08:27:16--  http://google.com/
my-wget-tests-attempt> Resolving google.com (google.com)... failed: Temporary failure in name resolution.
my-wget-tests-attempt> wget: unable to resolve host address 'google.com'
error: builder for '/nix/store/aidsrs8xpb32dr37pfqlsca2ag94mm1s-my-wget-tests-attempt-1-normal-derivation.drv' failed with exit code 4
```

You can see here that because of the Nix build sandbox, `wget` is not able to
connect to the internet.  In order to work around this, we need to use an FOD[^4].

### Attempt 2: A Fixed-Output Derivation

As a second attempt, let's change to using an FOD:

[`my-wget-tests-attempt-2-fod/default.nix`](https://github.com/cdepillabout/example-fodonuts/blob/main/nix/my-wget-tests-attempt-2-fod/default.nix):

```nix
{ my-wget, lib, stdenv }:

stdenv.mkDerivation {

  name = "my-wget-tests-attempt-2-fod";

  # This is the sha256 hash for the string "success", which is output upon this
  # test succeeding.
  outputHash = "sha256-gbK9TqmMjbZlVPvI12N6GmmhMPMx/rcyt1yqtMSGj9U=";
  outputHashMode = "flat";
  outputHashAlgo = "sha256";

  nativeBuildInputs = [ my-wget ];

  # Needed for people using Nix behind a proxy.
  impureEnvVars = lib.fetchers.proxyImpureEnvVars;

  buildCommand = ''
    wget http://www.google.com -O index.html

    echo success > "$out"
  '';
}
```

Let's try building this:

```console
$ nix build -L .#my-wget-tests-attempt-2-fod
my-wget-tests-attempt> --2023-07-20 09:33:41--  http://www.google.com/
my-wget-tests-attempt> Resolving www.google.com (www.google.com)... 172.217.161.36, 2404:6800:4004:826::2004
my-wget-tests-attempt> Connecting to www.google.com (www.google.com)|172.217.161.36|:80... connected.
my-wget-tests-attempt> HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK
my-wget-tests-attempt> Length: unspecified [text/html]
my-wget-tests-attempt> Saving to: 'index.html'
my-wget-tests-attempt> 2023-07-20 09:33:41 (708 KB/s) - 'index.html' saved [20892]
```

Success!  Since we're building in an FOD, `wget` is now able to connect to the
internet.  After building this once, if we try rebuilding, nothing happens,
since the result is cached in our Nix store.

However, we have a problem here.  Even if we change the `my-wget` derivation,
this `my-wget-tests-attempt-2-fod` derivation won't be rebuilt.  Let's look at
an example of this.

Try changing `my-wget` to be defined like the following:

```nix
final: prev: {
  my-wget =
    final.wget.overrideAttrs {
      pname = "my-wget";
      postInstall = ''
        rm $out/bin/wget
      '';
    };
}
```

We've introduced an obvious problem to the `my-wget` derivation.  It builds
correctly, but we've accidentally deleted the output `wget` binary we're
expecting to use!  This is something that should definitely be caught by our
tests, so lets try running them one more time.

```console
$ nix build -L .#my-wget-tests-attempt-2-fod
```

Hmm, this succeeds.  We're not seeing a test failure like we expect.
What's going on here?

As explained above, if you keep the `name` and `hash` values the same,
but change anything else in the derivation (including things like our
`my-wget` dependency), the derivation will not be rebuilt when running
`nix build`.

When you run `nix build`, Nix sees that it has already built a derivation with
the same `name` and `hash`, and just uses that result.

As an example, try changing the `name` of the derivation from

```nix
name = "my-wget-tests-attempt-2-fod";
```

to

```nix
name = "my-wget-tests-attempt-2-fod-foobar";
```

and rebuilding.  You can see that it tries to rebuild the derivation, and
fails, as expected:

```console
$ nix build -L .#my-wget-tests-attempt-2-fod
my-wget-tests-attempt> /nix/store/fzb9wy1yz0hn69vxw12954szvrjnjjgk-stdenv-linux/setup: line 1559: wget: command not found
error: builder for '/nix/store/k79v1rh11g80sfdmhx7jsnijka081z5x-my-wget-tests-attempt-2-fod-foobar.drv' failed with exit code 127;
```

We would ideally like some way to have the `my-wget-tests-attempt-2` derivation
to be rebuilt whenever the `my-wget` input changes.  Let's see how we can
accomplish this.

### Attempt 3: A Fixed-Output Derivation with a Special Name

There is an easy way to make sure the tests are actually run when the underlying
`my-wget` derivation changes. Put the output hash of `my-wget` into the
name of tests.  Let's look at an example of this:

[`my-wget-tests-attempt-3-fod-special-name/default.nix`](https://github.com/cdepillabout/example-fodonuts/blob/main/nix/my-wget-tests-attempt-3-fod-special-name/default.nix):

```nix
{ my-wget, lib, stdenv }:

let
  my-wget-hash = builtins.hashString "md5" my-wget.outPath;
in

stdenv.mkDerivation {

  name = "my-wget-tests-attempt-3-fod-special-name-${my-wget-hash}";

  # This is the sha256 hash for the string "success", which is output upon this
  # test succeeding.
  outputHash = "sha256-gbK9TqmMjbZlVPvI12N6GmmhMPMx/rcyt1yqtMSGj9U=";
  outputHashMode = "flat";
  outputHashAlgo = "sha256";

  nativeBuildInputs = [ my-wget ];

  # Needed for people using Nix behind a proxy.
  impureEnvVars = lib.fetchers.proxyImpureEnvVars;

  buildCommand = ''
    wget http://www.google.com -O index.html

    echo success > "$out"
  '';
}
```

Here, `my-wget.outPath` will look something like:

```console
$ nix repl
nix-repl> :lf ./.
nix-repl> packages.x86_64-linux.my-wget.outPath
"/nix/store/0npkkrijy52bhpcb1g7r2h9jvgv8ym17-my-wget-1.21.4"
```

This is the full path to the derivation output in the Nix store.  Hashing this
gives us a value like the following:

```console
nix-repl> builtins.hashString "md5" packages.x86_64-linux.my-wget.outPath
"6311bc8ae58b49e918900025ead0d10b"
```

So the full `name` of the test becomes:

```console
nix-repl> packages.x86_64-linux.my-wget-tests-attempt-3-fod-special-name.name
"my-wget-tests-attempt-3-fod-special-name-6311bc8ae58b49e918900025ead0d10b"
```

Let's build this test and confirm it succeeds:

```console
$ nix build -L .#my-wget-tests-attempt-3-fod-special-name
my-wget-tests-attempt> --2023-07-22 07:11:29--  http://www.google.com/
my-wget-tests-attempt> Resolving www.google.com (www.google.com)... 142.251.42.132, 2404:6800:4004:825::2004
my-wget-tests-attempt> Connecting to www.google.com (www.google.com)|142.251.42.132|:80... connected.
my-wget-tests-attempt> HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK
my-wget-tests-attempt> Length: unspecified [text/html]
my-wget-tests-attempt> Saving to: 'index.html'
my-wget-tests-attempt> index.html              [ <=>                ]  18.90K  --.-KB/s    in 0.02s
my-wget-tests-attempt> 2023-07-22 07:11:29 (762 KB/s) - 'index.html' saved [19355]
```

Just to make sure, let's change the `my-wget` derivation again so that it is
broken:

```nix
final: prev: {
  my-wget =
    final.wget.overrideAttrs {
      pname = "my-wget";
      postInstall = ''
        rm $out/bin/wget
      '';
    };
}
```

Let's confirm in the repl that the hash `my-wget`, used in the name of the test, has
changed:

```console
$ nix repl
nix-repl> :lf ./.
nix-repl> packages.x86_64-linux.my-wget-tests-attempt-3-fod-special-name.name
"my-wget-tests-attempt-3-fod-special-name-0efdb406714d5f4f279d23c888870f1b"
```

Great, it has changed! Now when we try to rebuild the test, it should actually
be rebuilt:

```console
$ nix build -L .#my-wget-tests-attempt-3-fod-special-name
my-wget-tests-attempt> /nix/store/fzb9wy1yz0hn69vxw12954szvrjnjjgk-stdenv-linux/setup: line 1559: wget: command not found
error: builder for '/nix/store/4vsk6n3lyq6q5l9rrv3d8zyq6piklq4g-my-wget-tests-attempt-3-fod-special-name-0efdb406714d5f4f279d23c888870f1b.drv' failed with exit code 127;
```

Success!  Err, failure... but that's what we were hoping for!

So this seems like it is working well, and doing what we expect.  This example
is the heart of a _fixed-output derivation for operating network-utilizing tests_ (**FODNUT**):

> What is a **FODONUT**?
>
> A FODONUT is a _fixed-output derivation_ with a special `name`. Take a

There is, however, still one problem here[^5].

Imagine we want to change the test derivation itself.  Right now it is
downloading an HTML file from <http://www.google.com>, but we want to change it
to instead download an HTML file from <http://www.example.com>.  Let's make
that change:

```nix
{ my-wget, lib, stdenv }:

let
  my-wget-hash = builtins.hashString "md5" my-wget.outPath;
in

stdenv.mkDerivation {

  name = "my-wget-tests-attempt-3-fod-special-name-${my-wget-hash}";

  # This is the sha256 hash for the string "success", which is output upon this
  # test succeeding.
  outputHash = "sha256-gbK9TqmMjbZlVPvI12N6GmmhMPMx/rcyt1yqtMSGj9U=";
  outputHashMode = "flat";
  outputHashAlgo = "sha256";

  nativeBuildInputs = [ my-wget ];

  # Needed for people using Nix behind a proxy.
  impureEnvVars = lib.fetchers.proxyImpureEnvVars;

  buildCommand = ''
    wget http://www.example.com -O index.html

    echo success > "$out"
  '';
}
```

And try rebuilding the test:

```console
$ nix build -L .#my-wget-tests-attempt-3-fod-special-name
```

Hmm, it doesn't rebuild.  This is because we changed the test derivation
itself, but we haven't changed the `my-wget` derivation at all. Again, Nix
sees that it has already built a FOD with this `name` and `hash`, so doesn't
try to rebuild.

The solution to this problem leads us to a full FODONUT.

### Attempt 4: A Full FODONUT

A straightforward solution to this is to just hash the full test script, and
stick it into the `name` of the test derivation.  Here's an example of what
this might look like:

```nix
{ my-wget, lib, stdenv }:

let
  buildCommand = ''
    wget http://www.google.com -O index.html

    echo success > "$out"
  '';

  value-to-hash = buildCommand + my-wget.outPath;

  test-name-hash = builtins.hashString "md5" value-to-hash;
in

stdenv.mkDerivation {

  name = "my-wget-tests-attempt-4-fodonut-${test-name-hash}";

  # This is the sha256 hash for the string "success", which is output upon this
  # test succeeding.
  outputHash = "sha256-gbK9TqmMjbZlVPvI12N6GmmhMPMx/rcyt1yqtMSGj9U=";
  outputHashMode = "flat";
  outputHashAlgo = "sha256";

  nativeBuildInputs = [ my-wget ];

  # Needed for people using Nix behind a proxy.
  impureEnvVars = lib.fetchers.proxyImpureEnvVars;

  inherit buildCommand;
}
```

Here, you can see that we are hashing both the full `buildCommand`, as well as
the output path of `my-wget`.  Let's confirm this builds:

```console
$ nix build -L .#my-wget-tests-attempt-4-fodonut
my-wget-tests-attempt> --2023-07-22 08:20:23--  http://www.google.com/
my-wget-tests-attempt> Resolving www.google.com (www.google.com)... 216.58.220.100, 2404:6800:4004:80a::2004
my-wget-tests-attempt> Connecting to www.google.com (www.google.com)|216.58.220.100|:80... connected.
my-wget-tests-attempt> HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK
my-wget-tests-attempt> Length: unspecified [text/html]
my-wget-tests-attempt> Saving to: 'index.html'
my-wget-tests-attempt> index.html              [ <=>                ]  18.88K  --.-KB/s    in 0.03s
my-wget-tests-attempt> 2023-07-22 08:20:23 (730 KB/s) - 'index.html' saved [19334]
```

Go back into the derivation and try changing the URL from

## Key Takeaways for FODONUTs

So what really are _fixed-output derivation for operating network-utilizing tests_ (**FODONUTs**)?

FODONUTs are the following:

1.  Fixed-output derivations that output a simple, known string, like "success".

2.  The derivation runs a test that requires access to the internet (so it won't
    build correctly in a normal sandboxed derivation).

3.  FODONUTs have a hash in their `name`.  The hash is carefully crafted to
    make sure rebuilds happen as a user might expect.

FODONUTs are quite useful for tests, but have a few downsides as well:

1.  They can really only output one bit of information: whether or not the
    tests succeed.  It is _not_ possible for the tests to output some sort of
    "test report", since FODs aren't able to output anything other than a
    previously known hashed value[^6].

2.  Once a test succeeds, it won't run again until its `name` or `hash`
    changes.  While this is exactly what we want in many scenarios, there are
    certain kinds of tests where the exact state of the data we are accessing
    on the internet has a big affect on the outcome of the test.  Data from
    the internet may change frequently, and cause frequent test failures.

    For instance, with the `my-wget` example, we are making sure `wget` can
    download the front page of Google.  In this case, Google is quite reliable.
    If `wget` is not able to download the front page of Google, is is likely a
    problem with `wget`, not Google.[^7]

    As a rule of thumb, FODONUTs only make sense for tests that download data
    that isn't going to frequently change.  Or, at least, data that won't
    change in a way that causes the tests to fail.  If you're using a FODONUT,
    and your tests frequently fail because of changes to data from the
    internet, you should rethink whether FODONUTs are right for your
    use-case[^8].

3.  Sometimes you have to be quite careful exactly what information ends up in
    the the `name` of a FODONUT.  You want to make sure this causes the
    derivation to be rebuilt only when it should be rebuilt.  You don't want
    too many rebuilds, and you don't want your tests to accidentally not get
    run when they should.

## Examples of FODONUTs in the Wild

I know of a few examples of FODONUTs in the wild:

1.  [Stack / Hpack version test](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/c78223a5fff5cd89819a88f23de03d3b8d45c796/pkgs/test/haskell/upstreamStackHpackVersion/default.nix)[^9]

    This is a test to make sure that the version of the `hpack` dependency used
    by `stack` in Nixpkgs matches the same version as upstream.  This test
    downloads a statically-linked `stack` binary from GitHub, and compares
    versions of the `hpack` dependency with the `stack` from Nixpkgs.

    There are two interesting things to notice here:

    1.  The `name` of the test derivation contains the `stack` and `hpack`
        [version numbers](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/c78223a5fff5cd89819a88f23de03d3b8d45c796/pkgs/test/haskell/upstreamStackHpackVersion/default.nix#L121C88-L121C88),
        so if the `stack` or `hpack` version is updated in Nixpkgs, this test
        derivation will be rebuilt.

        The Haskell infrastructure in Nixpkgs is setup so that `stack` and
        `hpack` may be updated semi-automatically, so this test derivation
        will helpfully catch when `stack` or `hpack` are updated to versions
        that are incompatible with upstream releases.

    2.  You can see that the test script uses the
        [`cacert` derivation](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/c78223a5fff5cd89819a88f23de03d3b8d45c796/pkgs/test/haskell/upstreamStackHpackVersion/default.nix#L139).
        However, changes in the `cacert` derivation are not likely to cause
        this test to failing, so the `cacert` derivation is explicitly not
        included anywhere in the hash added to the test `name`.  We have to be
        somewhat careful with how we write the test script.

    You may be wondering why this couldn't just be split into a FOD that downloads
    the upstream statically-linked `stack` binary, and a separate, normal
    derivation that performs the test.

    It could be split-up like that, but then we'd have to manually bump the
    hash of the upstream `stack` binary.  Writing this as a FODONUT saves us
    the trouble of having to manually update the hash.

2.  The
    [tests for the fetchers in Nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/c78223a5fff5cd89819a88f23de03d3b8d45c796/pkgs/build-support/testers/default.nix#L80-L95),
    like
    [`fetchurl`](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/c78223a5fff5cd89819a88f23de03d3b8d45c796/pkgs/build-support/fetchurl/tests.nix#L5).

    While these aren't exactly FODONUTs, they do share some of the same tactics.

3.  [evil-nix](https://github.com/cdepillabout/evil-nix)

    This doesn't technically use FODONUTs, but it does contain a FOD with a
    [carefully constructed `name`](https://github.com/cdepillabout/evil-nix/blob/415e2fdc6b6897f2bff7f068edbc3d70a8b9ec2b/nix/evil/downloadBitNum.nix#L43).

I imagine there are more examples of FODONUTs being used in other projects and
proprietary repos.  If you have an example of a FODONUT, please share!

## Conclusion

While I'm sure I'm not the first to come up with the idea of using FODs to run
tests that access the internet, I haven't seen any other blog posts talking
about the idea.  This post is an attempt to write up an easy-to-understand
explanation of how FODONUTS work.

FODONUTs are quite a helpful technique for running tests within Nix
derivations.  When building software with Nix, it is very common to want to get
data from the internet to use in tests, but it is often too difficult or
annoying to download that data with a fixed-output derivation. FODONUTs can be
a nice compromise in this situation.

## Footnotes

[^1]: I read this as "foe donuts", or "faux donuts".

[^2]: Another common solution is to standup a webserver like Nginx on localhost
    within a normal Nix derivation, and make requests to it with `wget`.  The
    advantage with this is that everything happens within a normal Nix
    derivation, and in theory it is more reproducible than accessing something
    out on the internet.  The disadvantage is that you must download all
    resources required for the tests using FODs.  While this is possible for
    some types of tests, for others it is quite a big limitation.

[^3]: In theory, if you've already output one thing with a given name/hash, it
    doesn't matter if you change the build steps, you'll still get the same value
    if you rebuild it.

    In practice, I'm not sure how good of a decision this is, since it can be
    quite surprising to users when they update the build steps in an FOD, but
    forget to change the hash. But it is also nice in some ways.

[^4]: You can also work around this by disabling the build
    [`sandbox`](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/command-ref/conf-file.html#conf-sandbox):

    ```console
    $ nix build -L .#my-wget-tests-attempt-1-normal-derivation --option sandbox false
    ```

    But this requires you to run the build as a
    [`trusted-user`](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/command-ref/conf-file.html#conf-trusted-users),
    which is quite limiting, and not something that is allowed in Nixpkgs.

[^5]: There are a couple other things that we could talk about as well, which
    aren't important enough for the main post:

    1.  Is it safe to use an MD5 hash here?

        Yes.  There are no security implications here, so MD5 is alright.  It
        is extremely unlikely we get a collision, and it is really not the end
        of the world if there just happens to be a collision.

    2.  Is there a better method than hashing the full path of the `my-wget`
        output?

        Yes.  We could just take the hash from the path of the `my-wget`
        output, and use that.  For example, the full path of the `my-wget`
        output is:

        ```console
        $ nix path-info .#my-wget
        /nix/store/qn523zxch23jsa5jpc4b2fhr25zh85kn-my-wget-1.21.4
        ```

        Instead of MD5 hashing this path, we could just directly use the hash
        `qn523zxch23jsa5jpc4b2fhr25zh85kn`.  The big advantage of this is that
        we don't have to compute an MD5 hash again, and for people that use an
        alternative `/nix/store` path, they will get the same value.

        There really isn't any downside here, except it is slightly more
        difficult to code up and explain.

[^6]: Keep in mind that Nix builds have a concept of a "build log".  It is
    possible to output test failures to the build log, and inspect them at a
    later time.

    For instance, try changing the `my-wget-tests-attempt-4-fodonut` derivation
    to download from a domain `lalalathisdomaindoesnotexist.com` instead of
    `google.com`.  Here's what happens when you run this test:

    ```console
    $ nix build -L .#my-wget-tests-attempt-4-fodonut
    warning: Git tree '/home/illabout/git/example-fodonuts' is dirty
    my-wget-tests-attempt> --2023-07-22 11:30:59--  http://www.lalalathisdomaindoesnotexist.com/
    my-wget-tests-attempt> Resolving www.lalalathisdomaindoesnotexist.com (www.lalalathisdomaindoesnotexist.com)... failed: Name or service not known.
    my-wget-tests-attempt> wget: unable to resolve host address 'www.lalalathisdomaindoesnotexist.com'
    error: builder for '/nix/store/inw2snkn1cl7v6x83x0z03006q4rn8q7-my-wget-tests-attempt-4-fodonut-6c62f59d6308b771c9a6353f23f518e0.drv' failed with exit code 4;
    ```

    We can of course see the build failure here, and Nix also has a built-in
    way of viewing the build logs for this build failure:

    ```console
    $ nix log /nix/store/inw2snkn1cl7v6x83x0z03006q4rn8q7-my-wget-tests-attempt-4-fodonut-6c62f59d6308b771c9a6353f23f518e0.drv

    Resolving www.lalalathisdomaindoesnotexist.com (www.lalalathisdomaindoesnotexist.com)... failed: Name or service not known.
    wget: unable to resolve host address 'www.lalalathisdomaindoesnotexist.com'
    ```

[^7]: In practice, this likely depends on things like the stability of your
    internet, what sort of data you are downloading and using in your tests, etc.

[^8]: Another way to think about this: if your FODONUTs frequently fail because
    of changes to data from the internet, you likely want tests that are able to
    run more frequently than just whenever the underlying derivation changes.

    In our `my-wget` example, in practice, we might be really worried about the
    compatibility between `my-wget` and the upstream website we're trying to
    download from. However, the `my-wget` derivation might not change much, so
    the tests won't actually be run that often. In this case, a FODONUT might
    not be the best choice, and you should really try to find some way of
    running tests outside of a Nix derivation.

    If, for some reason, you don't have any way to run tests _except_ as Nix
    derivations, you might be able to force rebuilds of your FODONUT by
    using things like `builtins.currentTime` in the `name`.  Or possibly
    just turning off Nix's build-time sandox.
