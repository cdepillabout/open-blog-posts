title: Announcing password-2.0
summary: A library for working with passwords in Haskell
tags: haskell
draft: false
------------------------------------------------------

I recently helped with the release of the
[password-2.0](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-2.0.1.1) library.

This 2.0 release corresponds to a big rewrite of the `password` library,
spearheaded entirely by [Felix Paulusma](https://github.com/Vlix).

The biggest improvement in 2.0 is the addition of a few new options for hashing
algorithms, including
[Argon2](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-2.0.1.1/docs/Data-Password-Argon2.html),
[Bcrypt](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-2.0.1.1/docs/Data-Password-Bcrypt.html),
and
[PBKDF2](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-2.0.1.1/docs/Data-Password-PBKDF2.html).

## What is the `password` library?

The [`password`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-2.0.1.1) library
was originally intended to be used by people implementing username/password
authentication in web applications, but it is now easily usable by anyone
dealing with passwords and password hashing in any type of application.

There are four main advantages of using `password`:

-   Canonical
    [`Password`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-2.0.1.1/docs/Data-Password.html#t:Password)
    and
    [`PasswordHash`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-2.0.1.1/docs/Data-Password.html#t:PasswordHash)
    types that can be shared throughout your code. These are meant to be simple
    types with reasonable typeclass instances.  You should be able to take
    `password` as a dependency and rely on these types from other libraries.

-   Easy-to-use functions for hashing a `Password`, and checking a
    `PasswordHash` against a `Password`.

-   An optional
    [password-instances](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-instances-2.0.0.1)
    package that provides additional typeclass instances for `Password` and
    `PasswordHash`, like
    [`FromJSON`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-instances-2.0.0.1/docs/Data-Password-Instances.html#v:-36-fFromJSONPassword)
    (from [aeson](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson)),
    [FromHttpApiData](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-instances-2.0.0.1/docs/Data-Password-Instances.html#v:-36-fFromHttpApiDataPassword)
    (from [http-api-data](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/http-api-data)),
    and
    [PersistField](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-instances-2.0.0.1/docs/Data-Password-Instances.html#v:-36-fPersistFieldPasswordHash)
    (from [persistent](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/persistent)).  These
    instances are frequently used when doing actual web development.

-   Great documentation.  Anything confusing in the Haddocks is considered a
    "high-priority" bug.

## What changed in `password-2.0`?

`password-2.0` is a complete rewrite of the `password` library by
[Felix Paulusma](https://github.com/Vlix)[^1].  The architecture of the library
has been completely redone to support multiple hashing algorithms.

The following algorithms are now supported:

-   [Argon2](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-2.0.1.1/docs/Data-Password-Argon2.html)
-   [Bcrypt](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-2.0.1.1/docs/Data-Password-Bcrypt.html)
-   [PBKDF2](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-2.0.1.1/docs/Data-Password-PBKDF2.html)
-   [Scrypt](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-2.0.1.1/docs/Data-Password-Scrypt.html)
    (this was the only algorithm supported in the original `password-1.0` library)

`password-2.0` also adds a bunch of much-needed documentation, as well as many
tests.

## How to use `password`?

This section will present a short tutorial for using `password`.  The following
commands are run in a GHCi session.  You can follow along if you start GHCi
with a command like `stack --resolver nightly-2020-05-16 ghci --package
password-2.0.1.1`.

Enable the `OverloadedStrings` extension to make the following code a little
easier:

```haskell
> :set -XOverloadedStrings
```

The first step in using `password` is to pick which hashing algorithm you want to use.
If you don't know which to pick, we recommend
[Bcrypt](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-2.0.1.1/docs/Data-Password-Bcrypt.html).
The trade-offs of the different algorithms are discussed in more detail
[in the Haddocks](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-2.0.1.1/docs/Data-Password.html).

Once you've picked the hashing algorithm, you can import its module.  We use
[`Data.Password.Bcrypt`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-2.0.1.1/docs/Data-Password-Bcrypt.html)
as an example:

```haskell
> import Data.Password.Bcrypt
```

Next, we need a
[`Password`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-2.0.1.1/docs/Data-Password-Bcrypt.html#t:Password)
to work with.  Let's create one with
[`mkPassword`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-2.0.1.1/docs/Data-Password-Bcrypt.html#v:mkPassword)[^2]:

```haskell
> let pass = mkPassword "foobar"
> pass :: Password
**PASSWORD**
```

Note that the `Show` instance for `Password` doesn't actually show the
password.  This is a security measure.  You don't have to worry about passwords
leaking into your web application logs.

Now that you have a password, we can hash it with the
[`hashPassword`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-2.0.1.1/docs/Data-Password-Bcrypt.html#v:hashPassword)
function[^4].  This produces a
[`PasswordHash`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-2.0.1.1/docs/Data-Password-Bcrypt.html#t:PasswordHash):

```haskell
> hash <- hashPassword pass
> hash :: PasswordHash Bcrypt
PasswordHash {unPasswordHash = "$2b$10$IbnlktUyGjeunSlE4bQtfu89LY6veyDW0CGIoR5Kj8qrQa916txMS"}
```

This `PasswordHash` can be stored in a database[^3].

The
[`checkPassword`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-2.0.1.1/docs/Data-Password-Bcrypt.html#v:checkPassword)
function can be used to check a `Password` against a `PasswordHash`:

```haskell
> let result = checkPassword pass hash
> result :: PasswordCheck
PasswordCheckSuccess
```

## Future Work

There are a few issues in the `password` library that we'd like help with from
anyone interested.

-   Split off the
    [`Data.Password`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-2.0.1.1/docs/Data-Password.html)
    module into a separate package called `password-types`.

    All of the hashing algorithms provided in `password` come from
    [`cryptonite`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cryptonite).

    However, we would ideally like people to be able to use the `Password` and
    `PasswordHash` data types as canonical data types in different libraries on
    Hackage.  We don't want all these packages to have to pull in a transitive
    dependency on `cryptonite`.

    Ideally, we would have a `password-types` package that just exports
    everything from the current `Data.Password` module (which doesn't require a
    dependency on `cryptonite`).

    https://github.com/cdepillabout/password/issues/20

-   Split the
    [`password-instances`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-instances-2.0.0.1)
    package into separate packages.

    Currently, `password-instances` has instances for `Password` and
    `PasswordHash` for type classes from `aeson`, `http-api-data`, and
    `persistent`.

    Ideally, there would be a more fine-grained way to pick only the instances
    you want.

    For instance, if you're not using `persistent` to access a database, you
    shouldn't have to transitively depend on `persistent` just to get instances
    from `aeson`.

    https://github.com/cdepillabout/password/issues/1

-   Add more helpful instances to `password-instances`.

    `password-instances` has helpful instances from a few widely used libraries,
    but it is missing many more.

    If you use `password`, please consider contributing missing instances!

-   Support different hash formats.

    `password` has its own way of encoding hashes.  In the above example,
    you can see that the Bcrypt algorithm outputs hashes that look like this:
    `$2b$10$IbnlktUyGjeunSlE4bQtfu89LY6veyDW0CGIoR5Kj8qrQa916txMS`.

    This works well if you're writing your application from the beginning with
    `password`, but if you're trying to interoperate with password hashes
    produced by other languages and frameworks, you'll have to do some manual
    conversion.

    It would be nice to extend the `checkPassword` and `hashPassword` functions
    to be able to read/write password hashes in other formats.

    https://github.com/cdepillabout/password/issues/11

-   Add functionality for validating password complexity requirements.

    `password` currently doesn't provide any functionality for validating the
    complexity of passwords.  It would be nice if it provided an API for
    checking whether passwords are at least a given length, have a certain
    number of uppercase, lowercase, and special characters, etc.

    This might be of interest to anyone who likes designing easy-to-use APIs
    for complicated use-cases.

    https://github.com/cdepillabout/password/issues/9

-   Perform a security audit.

    We'd love to get an in-depth review from any security-minded Haskellers.
    `password` mostly just wraps around functionality provided by `cryptonite`,
    but it would still be great to get a review for the code we do have.

    If you find any big issues, feel free to
    [email me directly](https://functor.tokyo/about) if you don't feel
    comfortable creating a public issue on GitHub.

Please feel free to send pull requests or create issues for any of the above enhancements.

## Conclusion and Thanks

I need to give a big thanks to [Felix Paulusma](https://github.com/Vlix) for
`password-2.0`.  He is solely responsible for almost all the
[work](https://github.com/cdepillabout/password/pull/8) that went
into this 2.0 release.  Felix is now a full maintainer of `password`.

There were a few other people who contributed as well:

-   [Malte Brandy](https://github.com/maralorn) and
    [Falko Peters](https://github.com/informatikr) helped with an
    [issue](https://github.com/cdepillabout/password/issues/15) about a timing
    attack when checking password hashes.

-   [Tristan de Cacqueray](https://github.com/TristanCacqueray)
    helped to [fixed up](https://github.com/cdepillabout/password/pull/19) some
    of our Haddocks.

Thanks to everyone, and I hope we get more contributions in the future!

## Footnotes

[^1]: The bulk of this work happened in
    [this PR](https://github.com/cdepillabout/password/pull/8).

[^2]: In reality, you probably wouldn't create a password by hand like this, but
    instead get one in a JSON request.  The
    [`FromJSON`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-instances-2.0.0.1/docs/Data-Password-Instances.html#v:-36-fFromJSONPassword)
    instance for `Password` provided by
    [`password-instances`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-instances-2.0.0.1)
    makes this easy.

[^3]: This is made easier with the
    [`PersistField`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-instances-2.0.0.1/docs/Data-Password-Instances.html#v:-36-fPersistFieldPasswordHash)
    instance for `PasswordHash` from
    [`password-instances`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-instances-2.0.0.1).

[^4]: Note that
    [`PasswordHash`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-2.0.1.1/docs/Data-Password.html#t:PasswordHash),
    [`hashPassword`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-2.0.1.1/docs/Data-Password-Bcrypt.html#v:hashPassword),
    and
    [`checkPassword`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-2.0.1.1/docs/Data-Password-Bcrypt.html#v:checkPassword)
    all have a phantom parameter.  This is used to store the algorithm that was
    used to hash the password.  You are not able to call `checkPassword` on a
    hash produced from a different algorithm's `hashPassword`.
