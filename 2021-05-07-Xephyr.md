title: Xephyr for GUI over SSH X-Forwarding
summary: Xephyr can be used to show some GUI programs that don't work under normal X-Forwarding

------------------------------------------------------

X-Forwarding over SSH is a convenient way to run GUI programs on a remote
machine while having them shown on your local desktop.  This works well for
many programs, but there are a few that do not support X-Forwarding over SSH.

The programs that do not support this are generally using X Server extensions
that are not supported over SSH X-Forwarding.

One way to work around this is to use a program called
[`Xephyr`](https://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/Xephyr/), which implements the
X11 Server protocol in an X Window.  The X Window from Xephyr only needs
minimal X Server extensions, all of which are available over SSH X-Forwarding.
However, Xephyr supports running programs which require many advanced X Server
extensions.

## Installation

On most Linux distributions, the `Xephyr` binary is usually either provided by
the XOrg Server package, or by a separate package that just contains `Xephyr`.

On NixOS, the `Xephyr` binary is provided by the `xorg-server` package.  On
Debian/Ubuntu, the `Xephyr` binary is provided by the `xserver-xephyr` package.

## Usage

Using `Xephyr` is simple.  When you are SSH'd into a remote machine with
X-Forwarding enabled, run a command like the following:

```console
$ Xephyr -screen 1600x900 :1
```

This should open up a blank X Window that is 1600x900 in size.

In a separate console, run any GUI program with the `DISPLAY` environment
variable set to `:1`, as specified to `Xephyr`.  Below, I use
[`drawio`](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop).  `drawio` doesn't render
correctly when running under normal X-Forwarding, but it does render correctly
when running in Xephyr:

```console
$ DISPLAY=:1 drawio
```

One problem with this is that most GUI programs expect to be run in a window
manager.  Instead of directly running `drawio` in Xephyr, it may be easier to
run a light-weight window manager in Xephyr, and then run `drawio` in that window
manager.

Here is an example of running the window manager [Fluxbox](http://fluxbox.org/)
within Xephyr:

```console
$ DISPLAY=:1 startfluxbox
```

From within Fluxbox, you can open a terminal and directly run `drawio`.

## Conclusion

X-Forwarding over SSH works fine for most programs.  But when you have a GUI
program that relies on an advanced X Server extension, Xephyr can be a
convenient way to run it remotely.
